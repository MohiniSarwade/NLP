In the text matching between the supply side and the demand side, such as job searching, matchmaking service and other applications, there involve with a large number of items such as the company name, job name, technical name, place name, and fixed expressions, etc.They all can be classified as multi-word expressions, which play a decisive role in the text matching. Therefore, this paper expresses the text as multi-word expression set. The key issue is to obtain multi-word expressions.
As the current multi-word expression recognition also has a large time complexity, for the MWE-based text expression can be used in the actual system, it offline trains the hierarchical MWE algorithm (LLR)'s parameter, threshold, and online extracts MWE to construct the text feature set.Hierarchical MWE is build by a large corpus. The program is as follows. 1. Calculating the score of two adjacent units by Log Likelihood Ratio-based hierarchical reducing algorithm as formula(3).Construct the binary tree order by the score value. If the score of the node is greater than the given threshold, all the nodes except the leaf nodes of the binary tree whose root is the node involve above are candidate of MWE. This paper proposes a MED-based distance to calculate comparability degree between two sets of strings. This distance is asymmetric. It takes the unequal position of two sets into c onsideration. We use a set of MWE strings to f orm representation f or a
special type of texts where some MWEs are the m ost important index of the test. The MED-based distance between two sets of string is therefore used to
calculate matching degree between two texts. We apply the algorithm in the position searching system.Experiments show that the new measurement has higher performance c ompare with the c osine distance to calculate texts' matching degree.
